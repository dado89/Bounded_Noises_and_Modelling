# Master Dissertation and beyond
This repository contains work associated with the development of my Master dissertation in Pisa. The work focused on theoretical aspects of stochastic analysis (in particular existence, uniqueness, boundedness of families of Stochastic Differential Equations), and on the use of bounded stochastic processes in Pharmacokinetic modelling.

# Publication and Code
Two published papers on the theoretical investigations summarised above are linked: JMM=Journal of Mathematical Physics; SAA=Stochastic Analysis and Applications. In addition, one file is provided  (noises_deg.c) with the main code I wrote in C during my Master dissertation. This was used to model pharmacokinetics dynamics through bounded noises.

# Important Disclaimer
The code has been entirely written during my Master studies (2014), and is much less accompanied by comments than I do now. I plan to comment the code soon.
