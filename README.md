# Master Dissertation and beyond
This work deals with theoretical aspect of stochastic analysis (in particular existence, uniqueness, boundedness of families of Stochastic Differential Equations), as well as the use of bounded noises in modelling. Work mainly developed as topic of my Master Dissertation in Mathematics, Pisa.

# Publication and Code
Provided one published work on the theoretical investigations summarised above. A second manuscript has been submitted.

Also provided, one file (noises_deg.c) with the main code I wrote in C during my Master dissertation. This was used to model pharmacokinetics dynamics through bounded noises.
