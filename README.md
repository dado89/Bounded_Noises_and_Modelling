# Master Dissertation and beyond
This repository contains work associated with the development of my Master dissertation in Pisa. The dissertation focused on theoretical aspects of stochastic analysis (in particular existence, uniqueness and boundedness of families of Stochastic Differential Equations), and on the use of bounded stochastic processes in Pharmacokinetic modelling. Two articles were published out of the work. 

# Publication and Code
This repository contains the two published papers mentioned above: JMM=Journal of Mathematical Physics; SAA=Stochastic Analysis and Applications. 

In addition, a relatively limited number of C scripts written for the disseration are provided. The aim of the code was both to confirm (and guide) the theoretical investigations carried out in the dissertation, and to model pharmacokinetics dynamics through bounded noises.
Most of the scripts carry out specific tasks (e.g., sample random trajectories of the solution to a system of SDEs), using other routines I created. The definition of all these routines is in the script "List.c". 

# Important Disclaimer
The code has been written entirely during the development of my Master studies, in 2014. It does constitute the first organic piece of code I wrote, and the lack of comments shows my inexperience at the time. I now do my best to comment often line by line and make the code as readable as possible. I will add comments to the code posted here as soon as possible.
